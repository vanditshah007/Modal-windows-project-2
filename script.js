and in this three events key down means if the use press the key means press the key down than the function works
in the key up when the key is lifted means if the key is pressed and then lifted than the function come into the work here 
and click we already know 
here we are using the keydown function 
and in function we are also using the arguement here which is E we can obviously use any other argument but we are using this 
and in here that E will captures the key which is pressed everytime here means if the shift is pressed than it will be logged and if the enter is pressed than it will be logged in console.
here e.key means when the escape key is pressed than only goto second line 
and then we add here the other if which says that if a modal which doest not contain hidden classlist than add there hidden class list

in this way key values works here and they are pressed here in their way
